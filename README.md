# gameHUB
This repository is for my first year in Front End Development at Noroff, a fictional game company named gameHub.
Entirely writtein HTML & CSS.

## Description

### This projet is only for educational purposes.

gameHUB is a retro-styled game-blog and review site, it also sells low-priced games for gamers. 

## Design
The entire site is designed in Figma. During development it was tested in WAVE to check for any errors with the contrast in the design. This was a necessary test due to the usage of bold and bright colours to a darker blue background.

gameHUB is styled as a blog and review site for games, the games that are reviewed are the same games that gameHUB sells.

### Dependencies

A working computer and/or phone. It's supposed to be mobile-friendly, tablet-friendly, as well as web-friendly.

### Installing

Please review my repository if you want to, and all constructive feedback are welcome.
